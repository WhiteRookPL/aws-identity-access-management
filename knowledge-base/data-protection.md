# Data Protection

## Types of Data

### Customer Data

Customer content is defined as software (including machine images), data, text, audio, video or images that a customer or any end user transfers to AWS for processing, storage or hosting by AWS services in connection with that customer's account and any computational results that a customer or any end user derives from the foregoing through their use of AWS services. For example, customer content includes data stored on S3. Customer is the only owner of that data.

### Account Information

Account information is defined as information about a customer that a customer provides to AWS in connection with the creation or administration of a customer account. For example, account information includes names, user names, phone numbers, email addresses and billing information associated with a customer account.

The information practices described in the AWS Privacy Notice apply to account information: https://aws.amazon.com/privacy. AWS owns that data in order fulfill various objectives including billing, notification and marketing.

## EU Regulations

### Directive 95/46/EC

It is the current directive that manages data protection regulation and all AWS services are fully compliant with it.

### GDPR

General Data Protection Regulation is the biggest change regarding data protection since 1995 for European markets. This acronym covers official name which is `Regulation (EU) 2016/679`. All AWS services will comply with the GDPR when it becomes enforceable on May 25, 2018.

AWS is also a part of CISPE (https://cispe.cloud). The CISPE Code of Conduct helps cloud customers ensure that their cloud infrastructure provider is using appropriate data protection standards to protect their data in a manner consistent with the GDPR (that includes e.g. RDS and other hosted services).
